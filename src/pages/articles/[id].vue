        "Conventional agriculture requires large amounts of energy and resources to produce meat, and is one of the leading contributors to climate change. Hence, it is important to look into alternative meat products, which include cell based and plant based meats. This study took into account the multiple factors that contribute to social and environmental sustainability. It was found that cell based meats may be the best alternative meat option. ",
